# AU-Falcon-Steering-Controls
Simple 3D models of both the media buttons and cruise control buttons from an AU Falcon, designed to be more dense and difficult to break than the now aging original parts.

>***NOTE: these parts are not perfect, but should fit with a bit of gentle negotiating, as the plastic in the rear of the steering wheel is more forgiving to the rough measurements I had to make from my own broken housing***
